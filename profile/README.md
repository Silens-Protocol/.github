# 🌐 Silens – Decentralized AI Model Review & Governance

**Silens** is a community-driven Web3 platform for **auditing and governing AI models**.  
Users can submit AI models, test them with real prompts, and vote to approve, flag, or delist them — all powered by **CARV ID identity**, **on-chain smart contracts**, and deployed on **BNB Smart Chain**.

---

## 🎯 Why Silens?

> 🧠 What if AI systems could hallucinate facts — and no one could stop them?  
> 🧠 What if public trust in AI depended on platforms that users couldn't control?

**Silens** offers a decentralized, transparent, and reputation-based alternative.

### ✅ What You Can Do
- Submit and explore AI models
- Review models with real inputs and outputs
- Vote on proposals to approve, flag, or remove unsafe models
- Build reputation through CARV ID to unlock governance roles
